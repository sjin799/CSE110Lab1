# Who am I as a Programmer

>I believe I am those kind that programmer who struggles sometimes and have to google my way out from bugs. ~~The memes really called me out LOL~~ However, I really enjoy the moment when I finally figured out the issue and have my code work.

```
if (coding){
    headphones = true;
    focus = 100;
    conversation = null;
}
```

My experiences are like... all over places. I have done some data analysis which I don't know if that counts as programming. Here is my link to [my profile](https://goldiej1019.wixsite.com/jsqprofile).

My Top Tier list for Coding Language are:
1. C++
2. Java
